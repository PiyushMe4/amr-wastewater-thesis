# Project Documentation

This directory contains the core documentation for the research project: _"Medical Waste Influence on AMR Gene Patterns in Tier-2 Indian City Wastewater"_.

## Key Documents

- **[Implementation Log](IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md)**: A continuously updated record of procedures, technical milestones, and project history.
- **Visual Synopsis**: Conceptual and explanatory descriptions of the figures located in the `visualization/` directory.
- **[Interpretation Framework](../README.md#scope--interpretation-framework)**: Detailed logic for Tier-2 inference and population-level ecological interpretation.

## Visualization Framework

Tier-1 Indian and international wastewater datasets are used as reference baselines to contextualize resistance patterns, enabling inference relevant to Tier-2 urban settings characterized by mixed land use and incomplete wastewater infrastructure. All figures are conceptual and explanatory, supporting interpretation rather than empirical results.

## Interpretation Boundaries

Analysis is strictly constrained to population-level ecological patterns using baseline-referenced comparisons. Documentation and visualizations explicitly exclude causal, clinical, or transmission inference.
