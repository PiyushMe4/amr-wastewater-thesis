# AMR Characterization Using Wastewater Metagenomics

This repository documents the research workflow, dataset curation, and analysis steps for a Master's thesis focused on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) characterization using wastewater metagenomic data.

## Scope & Interpretation Framework

- **Comparative Analysis**: Hospital wastewater vs non-medical urban sewage.
- **Data Strategy**: Utilization of publicly available metagenomic datasets.
- **Resistome Profiling**: Characterization of antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) patterns.
- **One Health Context**: Environmental characterization of AMR within the urban interface.

**Tier-2 Inference Logic**:
Tier-2 relevance is defined by infrastructural characteristics, such as mixed land use and incomplete wastewater segregation, rather than administrative labels. No dataset is presented as a direct representation of a specific Tier-2 city; instead, inferences are conditional and comparative, using structural and infrastructural analogy to provide relevance to Tier-2 urban settings.

## Visualization Framework

All figures in this repository are conceptual and explanatory. Visualizations are intended to support interpretation and clarify the research methodology, rather than representing empirical results. Comparisons shown in visualizations are baseline-referenced, using Tier-1 Indian and international wastewater datasets as reference baselines to contextualize resistance patterns.

## Interpretation Boundaries

To maintain methodological transparency, the following boundaries are enforced:

- **Ecological Focus**: Analysis is constrained to population-level ecological patterns.
- **Baseline-Referenced Comparison**: Findings are contextualized against established reference datasets.
- **No Causal Inference**: This study does not provide causal, clinical, or transmission inference.
- **Aggregated Signal**: Wastewater data reflects collective urban pressure and not individual risk or source-specific causality.

## Status

- [x] Research Framework & Visualization Framework
- [ ] Dataset Selection & Curation (In Progress)
