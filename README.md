# AMR Surveillance Using Wastewater Metagenomics

This repository documents the research workflow, dataset curation, and analysis steps for a Master's thesis focused on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance using wastewater metagenomic data.

## Scope

- Hospital wastewater vs non-medical urban sewage
- Publicly available metagenomic datasets
- Resistome profiling and comparative analysis
- One Health and environmental surveillance context

## Status

- [x] Research Framework & Visualization Framework
- [ ] Dataset Selection & Curation (In Progress)

For a detailed record of all incorporated procedures, see the [Implementation Log](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md).
